# Menu-Card
Menu card template with CRUD functionality with glyphicon eye
Hi Guys, I have got a chance to woek for a UI template design. 
This template is used as a hotel menu(Can be used as a score card,configurable-workbook etc..), where all the items including the header, body and the footer are editable. 
Uses a glyphicon eye to hide the items and show the items.
Technology Stack
HTML5/CSS3
Javascript-Jquery
Bootstrap
Recommend using Brackets IDE
Configuring the template requires prior knowledge of HTML/css. Template is ready to run on you local machine.
